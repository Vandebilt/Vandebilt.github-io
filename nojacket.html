            <p><i>No Jacket Required is the third solo studio album by English drummer and singer-songwriter Phil Collins. It was originally released on 18 February 1985[1] on Virgin (UK and Ireland), Atlantic (US and Canada), and WEA (rest of the world). It features guest backing vocalists, including Helen Terry, Peter Gabriel and Sting. Some of the songs, like "Don't Lose My Number" and "Sussudio", were based around improvisation. Other songs, like "Long Long Way to Go", had a political message. "One More Night", "Sussudio", "Don't Lose My Number" and "Take Me Home" were released as singles, with corresponding music videos. All four singles were top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with "Sussudio" and "One More Night" reaching number one. The three singles that were released in the UK all reached the top 20 on the UK charts. Many of the songs, including "Take Me Home" and "Long Long Way to Go", have been featured in episodes of Miami Vice and Cold Case, and "The Man with the Horn" was re-written and re-recorded for the episode "Phil the Shill". "We Said Hello Goodbye" was remixed for the film Playing for Keeps.</i></p>
